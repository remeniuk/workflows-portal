    description: `Build custom automations with PandaDoc's API or logic steps to support proprietary systems or advanced workflows. Create specialized integrations, implement complex business logic, and connect with any system through custom code. Leverage AI capabilities by making calls to LLMs or AI agents to enhance your document workflows. The code is written in Python, the most common and widely supported language, making it easy to generate and maintain with the help of AI assistants.`,
    useCase: "Ideal for companies with in-house developers or integration partners, businesses using custom-built software, or those needing special signing and data flows.",
    example: `Imagine you're generating contracts where pricing depends on live inventory data from a custom warehouse system. A Custom Code Step can pull that information in real time, calculate the right price, and update the document â€” without any manual work. You can even integrate AI to analyze contract terms or generate personalized content based on customer data.`,
